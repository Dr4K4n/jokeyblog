My name is Markus Ullmann and I'm a developer familiar with many environments and languages. Buzzwords are often just that, so I decide to regulary dig deeper in current technologies like realtime communication in browsers, mobile devices and other stuff.

When not working on some code directly, I also do security research and enjoy leading a gaming clan for Trackmania and Team Fortress as well as weekly bowling and swimming.

Work
====
My blog title is a result from my daily work which involves testing electronic devices in many ranges, devices for planes at the moment. Originally I used to work with and design PLC applications. To formalize the process of being able to design industrial controllers on my own and take responsibility for it, I decided to jump from industrial technician to a german "Diplom Ingenieur" degree.
